# new-era

New era is a fault-tolerant Earthquake Emergancy Alert System that can be deployed with an IOT device to warn the public as soon as possible. In the event that there are major infrastructure failures the system should be able to overcome relevant issues to still provide alerting to users. This project is part of Phase 1 for the West Coast ShakeAlert System hosted by the United States Geological Service (USGS) in alerting in California, Oregon, and Washington.
